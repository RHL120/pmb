# Problem set 3
## Ex 1
|Table|i|ii|iii|iv|
|-----|-|--|---|--|
|I|X|X|||
|II|||||
|III|X|X|X||
|IV|X||||

## Ex 2
The 2 possible tables are:

|⋆|e|a|
|-|-|-|
|e|e|a|
|a|a|e|

|⋆|e|a|
|-|-|-|
|e|e|a|
|a|a|a|

The first one is commutative and the second is a group

## Ex 3
|⋆|e|a|b|
|-|-|-|-|
|e|e|a|b|
|a|a|b|e|
|b|b|e|a|

## Ex 4
Assume for the purposes of contradiction, that we have a monoid M with 2 ids *a*
and *b*\
If we were to compose *a* and *b*:\
If *a* ⋆ *b* = *b*, then *b*, by definition is not an id\
If *a* ⋆ *b* = *a*, then *a*, by definition is not an id\
If *a* ⋆ *b* = *c*, then by definition nither a nor b are ids an id

## Ex 5
|⋆|e|a|b|c|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|e|e|a|b|c|
|a|a|b|c|e|
|b|b|c|e|a|
|c|e|e|e|e|
